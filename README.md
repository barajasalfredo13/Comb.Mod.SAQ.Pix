Note:  Currently I am thinking of two designs for the steel vessel. The first design will not need a redesign of the first vessel. The second design will reduce the size of the collection board and will be exchangable as long as a support is built for it. The support item has been standardized so that it is not difficult to upgrade for larger channel support
